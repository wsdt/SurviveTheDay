**Please do not forget to add a related annotation in the code itself (see ReadMe.md).**

- {Short description in 1-3 sentences}
- {Describe the problem, new feature or what you want to change}
- {Describe a possible solution to that problem, feature or desired code}
- {Add a list of classes which might need to be changed in order to implement the new feature/solve the bug. Please append the class filetype (Human.class) so we can avoid confusions. If a class hasn't been created yet, then you can use a recommended name by adding the [N] cue to it. (e.g.: Human.class[N])}
- {Maybe also add videos/pictures} *(OPTIONAL)*
